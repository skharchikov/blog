# Rust Web Development in 2024

The Rust web ecosystem has matured significantly in recent years. What was once a fragmented landscape has evolved into a rich ecosystem with multiple excellent choices.

## Popular Frameworks

1. **Leptos** - Reactive UI framework with CSR and SSR support
2. **Yew** - Component-based framework inspired by React
3. **Dioxus** - Cross-platform UI framework
4. **Axum** - Backend web framework built on Tokio

## Tooling

The Rust web development experience has improved dramatically with tools like:

- **Trunk**: Asset bundling and WASM building
- **wasm-pack**: Building and publishing WASM packages
- **cargo-leptos**: Leptos-specific build tool

## The Future

Rust's web ecosystem continues to grow. With WebAssembly becoming more mainstream and Rust's memory safety guarantees, we're seeing more companies adopt Rust for web development.

The future looks bright for Rust on the web!
