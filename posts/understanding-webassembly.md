# Understanding WebAssembly

WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format that runs in web browsers at near-native speed. It's a game-changer for web performance.

## What is WebAssembly?

WebAssembly is a low-level bytecode format that can be executed at near-native speed in modern browsers. It's designed to be a compilation target for languages like Rust, C++, and Go.

## Benefits of WASM

- **Performance**: Near-native execution speed
- **Portability**: Run the same code across different platforms
- **Security**: Sandboxed execution environment
- **Interoperability**: Works alongside JavaScript

## Use Cases

WebAssembly excels in compute-intensive applications:

- Game engines and graphics
- Video and audio processing
- Scientific simulations
- Cryptography
- Image manipulation

## WASM and Rust

Rust has first-class support for WebAssembly. The combination of Rust's performance and safety with WASM's portability makes it an excellent choice for web applications.

With tools like wasm-bindgen, you can easily interact between Rust and JavaScript code, getting the best of both worlds.
