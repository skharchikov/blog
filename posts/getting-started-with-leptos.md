Leptos is a cutting-edge Rust web framework that brings the power of fine-grained reactivity to the web. It compiles to WebAssembly and provides a modern development experience.

## Why Leptos?

- **Performance**: Compiles to WebAssembly for near-native speed
- **Reactivity**: Fine-grained reactive system similar to SolidJS
- **Type Safety**: Full Rust type safety in your frontend code
- **Modern DX**: Great developer experience with hot reloading

## Getting Started

To start with Leptos, you'll need to install Trunk, which is the build tool for Rust WASM applications:

```bash
cargo install trunk
```

Then create a new project and add Leptos as a dependency. You can start building reactive UIs that are both fast and type-safe!

## Next Steps

Check out the official Leptos documentation for more examples and guides. The community is friendly and growing rapidly.
