Stumbled upon [this video](https://youtu.be/V-pACEENHBw?si=2Z3w0RLN_eex2-9K) a while back and couldn't resist building one myself. The design looked great and I had a spare Pi 4 lying around anyway.

## The Build

Printed all the parts on my Bambu Lab P1S. Ordered the remaining components (screws, cables, some small electronics) and followed along with the video.

The most annoying part? Soldering the FFC cable connector. That thing kept falling off. Re-soldered it 3-4 times before it finally held. Probably a skill issue on my end, but man, it was frustrating.

Here's the build process:

## What It's Running

Now it's sitting on my desk running a few Docker containers:
- Home Assistant for smart home stuff
- A couple other self-hosted services

The Pi 4 handles it all without breaking a sweat. Pretty solid for a machine this tiny.

## Worth It?

Yeah, definitely. It's functional, looks cool on the desk, and was fun to build. If you've got a spare weekend and a Pi collecting dust, give it a shot.
